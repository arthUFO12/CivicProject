# Civic Engineering Team - Fullstack Project Assignment

## Overview

This is a **pass/fail** assignment for applicants joining the core engineering team at Civic. You must complete this project to demonstrate your proficiency in modern web development technologies and practices.

## Project Requirements

### Core Technology Stack

- **Next.js** (latest stable version)
- **Plate.js** (rich text editor)
- **TypeScript** (required)
- **Shadcn/ui** (for popover components)

### Application Structure

Create a Next.js application with two separate pages:

- `/happy` - Text editor with AI that rewrites content to be positive/happy
- `/sad` - Text editor with AI that rewrites content to be negative/sad

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Next.js Setup

- Initialize a new Next.js application using TypeScript
- Set up proper routing for the `/happy` and `/sad` pages
- Use modern Next.js App Router

### 2. Plate.js Integration

#### Both Pages Must Include

- Full Plate.js rich text editor implementation
- Proper TypeScript configuration
- Clean, maintainable code structure

#### AI Slash Commands

- **On `/happy` page**: Implement a slash command that takes user input and rewrites it to be happy/positive
- **On `/sad` page**: Implement a slash command that takes user input and rewrites it to be sad/negative

**Example slash command behavior:**

```text
User types: "The weather is okay today /rewrite"
AI processes and returns: "The weather is absolutely beautiful today!" (on happy page)
AI processes and returns: "The weather is dreary and disappointing today" (on sad page)
```

### 3. Data Persistence

- **Local Storage Integration**: Save editor content to local storage
- **Persistence**: When users refresh the page, their content should be restored
- **Code Reusability**: Minimize code duplication between the two pages

### 4. Custom Interactive Elements

Create custom Plate.js element types for enhanced interactivity:

- **Custom Element Types**: Implement custom Plate.js plugins to create unique element types when the user types in the words "happy" or "sad"
- **Pointer Cursor**: Text with "happy" or "sad" element types should show a **pointer cursor** on hover
- **Click Interaction**: Users should be able to click on "happy" or "sad" text elements
- **Shadcn Popover Integration**: Clicking should trigger a shadcn popover that displays:
  - A random happy quote when clicking "happy" text
  - A random sad quote when clicking "sad" text
- **Cross-Page Functionality**: This behavior should work on both `/happy` and `/sad` pages
- **Proper Typing**: Implement full TypeScript support for the custom element types

### 5. Real-time Collaboration

- Implement Plate.js collaboration features as demonstrated in the [official collaboration example](https://platejs.org/docs/examples/collaboration)
- Use the YjsPlugin with WebRTC or HocusPocus providers for real-time synchronization
- Two users in separate browsers should be able to edit the same document simultaneously
- Implement room-based collaboration (users can share room IDs to collaborate)

### Custom Element Implementation Example

**Expected behavior for custom elements:**

```text
Example content: "I feel happy today because the weather is nice"

- The word "happy" should be a custom Plate.js element with type "happy-text"
- Hovering shows pointer cursor
- Clicking triggers shadcn popover with a random happy quote like:
  "Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions." - Dalai Lama
```

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**

- Create custom Plate.js plugins for `happy-text` and `sad-text` element types
- Implement element detection (transform regular text containing "happy"/"sad" into custom elements)
- Use shadcn popover component with quote data
- Maintain element state during serialization/deserialization for local storage
- Ensure elements work with collaboration (other users see the same interactive elements)

### Key Implementation Guidelines

#### AI Integration

- You may use any AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.)

#### Local Storage

- Create a reusable hook for local storage operations
- Handle edge cases (storage quotas, JSON parsing errors)
- Implement proper TypeScript typing for stored data

#### Collaboration

- Follow the [Plate.js collaboration example](https://platejs.org/docs/examples/collaboration) implementation
- Use YjsPlugin with WebRTC or HocusPocus providers as demonstrated
- Implement room-based collaboration with shareable room IDs
- Handle user identification and cursor colors for multi-user editing

#### Custom Interactive Elements

- Create custom Plate.js plugins for "happy" and "sad" element types
- Implement proper element detection, rendering, and click handling
- Integrate shadcn popover components with quote data
- Use TypeScript interfaces for custom element data structures
- Ensure custom elements work seamlessly with collaboration features
- Handle element serialization for local storage persistence

#### Shadcn UI Integration

- Set up shadcn/ui components in your Next.js project
- Use the Popover component for displaying quotes
- Implement proper styling and theming
- Ensure components work with the overall design system
